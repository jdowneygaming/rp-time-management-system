# Role Play Time Management™ – Quickstart

This package includes a full, ready-to-run time management system for roleplay communities (FiveM, GTARP, etc), supporting multi-department shift tracking, bonuses, achievements, admin/boss dashboards, and detailed reporting.

## Getting Started

1. **Google Apps Script Backend**
   - Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com).
   - Create a new project.
   - Copy-paste the entire `Code.gs` contents into the script editor.
   - Deploy as a Web App: set “Anyone” can access (for testing), “execute as Me.”

2. **Frontend Files**
   - For each HTML file (`login.html`, `register.html`, etc):
     - Open in any HTML editor, VS Code, Notepad++ or Google Apps Script “HTML” files if using Apps Script’s built-in frontend.
     - Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_URL` in each file with your deployed backend URL.
     - Publish your site or use Apps Script’s web app frontend.
   
3. **Initial Setup**
   - Edit the spreadsheet to match your needs (sheet/tab names: Roster, DutyEntries, Audit, Bonus, DepartmentRoles, BonusScale, etc).
   - Adjust role emails and superadmins in `admin.html` and backend if needed.

4. **Features**
